# Finder-Tweaks
Tweaks and Addons for Finder that I use on my personal and work machines

## Available Tweaks
- [Open in Atom](./Open-In-Atom/ABOUT.md)
- [Open in iTerm](./Open-In-iTerm/ABOUT.md)

## How to Install
1. Open `Automator`, create a new Application
2. Search for `Run from AppleScript` and drag it into the main window
3. Copy & Paste the appropriate `AppleScript` code into Automator, replacing the template code
4. `File` -> `Save...` -> Name and save in a safe location.
  - For example, I keep mine in a `bin` folder in my Home Directory
5. Right click and `Get Info` on both your application and an application whose icon you wish to copy
  - I.e., for `Open-In-Iterm`, I copied the `iTerm` icon.
6. Click the icon image and `Copy` it. Then, click the icon image of your app and `Paste` it.
7. [Add your new application to the Finder Toolbar](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/customize-finder-toolbar-sidebar-mac-mchlp3011/mac)
